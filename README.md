# Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project 6

This project uses the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework to write various tests for a simple RSS reader application.

It is based on the [project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

Open `index.html` and the tests will run automagically. See the Jasmine section at the bottom for test results.

An additional test is called "Add Feeds to list" that tests that DOM content is uploaded when new feed is loaded.

See references.txt for resources used.
